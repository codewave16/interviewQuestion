    #### Question 1
    You are given two strings `s` and `t` such that every character occurs at most once in `s` and `t` is a permutation
    of `s`.

    The permutation difference between `s` and `t` is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of
    the occurrence of each character in `s` and the index of the occurrence of the same character in `t`.

    Return the permutation difference between `s` and `t`.

    #### Example 1:

    Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"

    Output: 2

    Explanation:

    For `s = "abc"` and `t = "bac"`, the permutation difference of `s` and `t` is equal to the sum of:

    - The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of `"a"` in `s` and the index of the occurrence of
    `"a"` in `t`.
    - The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of `"b"` in `s` and the index of the occurrence of
    `"b"` in `t`.
    - The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of `"c"` in `s` and the index of the occurrence of
    `"c"` in `t`.

    That is, the permutation difference between `s` and `t` is equal to `|0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2`.

    #### Example 2:

    Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"

    Output: 12

    Explanation: The permutation difference between `s` and `t` is equal to `|0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4
    - 0| = 12`.

    #### Constraints:

    - 1 <= s.length <=26 - Each character occurs at most once in `s`. - `t` is a permutation of `s`. - `s` consists only
      of lowercase English letters. </md-block>

        #### Question 2
        What is the next pattern?

        #### Question 3
        You are given two tables: **Students** and **Grades**. **Students** contains three columns: ID, Name, and Marks.

        ![table](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12891/1443818166-a5c852caa0-1.png)

        **Grades** contains the following data:

        ![table](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12891/1443818137-69b76d805c-2.png)

        Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade, and Mark. Ketty doesn't want
        the names of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade
        -- i.e., higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned
        to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8,
        use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student
        with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

        Write a query to help Eve.

        ##### Sample Input

        ![table](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12891/1443818093-b79f376ec1-3.png)

        ##### Sample Output
        |Name|Grade|Mark|
        |-|-|-|
        Maria|10|99
        Jane|9 |81
        Julia| 9 |88
        Scarlet| 8| 78
        NULL |7 |63
        NULL |7 |68

        #### Note

        Print "NULL" as the name if the grade is less than 8.

        #### Question 4
        [SQL] Refer to the following table
        DML for the table
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE tblSailor(
        sid int PRIMARY KEY,
        sname nvarchar(255),
        rating int,
        age float
        )
        ```
        Please write a SQL query :
        Find those ratings for which the average age of the sailors is the minium over all ratings.

        #### Question 5
        What should come next after April?
        <p>January</p>
        <p>February</p>
        <p>April</p>
        <p>July</p>
        <p>November</p>
        <p>April</p>
        <p>__________?</p>

        #### Question 6
        Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not,
        return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

        #### Example 1:
        **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 5`
        **Output:** `2`

        ##### Example 2:
        **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 2`
        **Output:** `1`

        ##### Example 3:
        **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 7`
        **Output:** `4`

        #### Constraints:

        - `1 <= nums.length <=10^4`
        - `-10^4 <=nums[i] <=10^4` 
        - `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending
          order. 
        - `-10^4 <=target <=10^4` 
        
        ```python 
        class Solution(object): def searchInsert(self, nums, target): """
                :type nums: List[int]
                :type target: int
                :rtype: int
                """ 
        </md-block>
